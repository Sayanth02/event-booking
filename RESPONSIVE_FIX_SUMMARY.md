# Responsive Design Fix Summary

## Issue
The function selecting components were not responsive and cards were breaking on smaller screens due to a horizontal scrolling grid layout that didn't wrap properly.

## Root Cause
- `FunctionSelector.tsx` used `grid-flow-col auto-cols-fr` which created a horizontal scrolling layout
- Components lacked proper responsive breakpoints for mobile devices
- Fixed padding and spacing didn't adapt to smaller screens

## Changes Made

### 1. **FunctionSelector.tsx** (Primary Fix)
- **Line 52**: Changed grid from `grid-flow-col auto-cols-fr` to responsive grid:
  ```tsx
  // Before
  <div className="grid grid-flow-col auto-cols-fr gap-4">
  
  // After
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-3 md:gap-4">
  ```
- Added responsive padding and text sizes throughout
- Made wedding label section responsive with smaller text on mobile

### 2. **FunctionButton.tsx**
- Added responsive padding: `p-3 sm:p-4`
- Added minimum height with responsive values: `min-h-[80px] sm:min-h-[90px]`
- Made button a flex container for better content centering
- Responsive icon sizes: `w-4 h-4 sm:w-5 sm:h-5`
- Responsive text sizes: `text-xs sm:text-sm`
- Added `break-words` for long function names
- Responsive checkmark positioning and sizing

### 3. **SelectedFunctionCard.tsx**
- Responsive padding: `p-3 sm:p-5`
- Responsive spacing: `space-y-3 sm:space-y-4`
- Header wraps on mobile with `flex-wrap gap-2`
- Grid layout: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3` for date/time inputs
- Duration display stacks on mobile: `flex-col sm:flex-row`
- Crew section grid: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`
- All text and icon sizes are responsive

### 4. **SelectedFunctions.tsx**
- Responsive padding and spacing
- Responsive title sizes: `text-lg sm:text-xl`

### 5. **CardContainer.tsx**
- Responsive padding: `p-3 sm:p-4 md:p-6`
- Responsive title sizes and dot indicator
- Responsive subtitle text

### 6. **step-2/page.tsx**
- Responsive spacing throughout: `space-y-4 sm:space-y-6 md:space-y-8`
- Responsive navigation buttons with proper padding and text sizes
- Added gap between navigation buttons

## Responsive Breakpoints Used
- **Mobile**: Default (< 640px) - 2 columns for function cards
- **sm**: 640px+ - 3 columns for function cards
- **md**: 768px+ - 4 columns for function cards
- **lg**: 1024px+ - 5 columns for function cards

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on mobile devices (320px - 480px width)
2. Test on tablets (768px - 1024px width)
3. Test on desktop (1024px+ width)
4. Verify function cards wrap properly and don't overflow
5. Verify all text is readable at all screen sizes
6. Verify buttons and inputs are properly sized and clickable on mobile

## Result
- Function selector cards now wrap properly on all screen sizes
- All components are fully responsive with appropriate padding and text sizes
- Better mobile UX with touch-friendly button sizes
- No horizontal scrolling or broken layouts on small screens
